# LogPicker
Just picks up logs upstairs lumby, eventually this will be my ironman efficiency bot.


Using Runemate API...


This bot just picks up logs in Upstairs lumbridge, banks them, then hops worlds if there are no visible logs.


Eventually this will be built to complete the ironman efficiency guide https://nightleaf.org/guide/page/1
